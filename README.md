# ling575
Term project for LING 575 Spoken Dialog Systems

## To do
- Expand store/restaurant list
- Add an option to spell your query
- Get user's location
- Text back the response
- Fix hours bug: getDay returns "local" time, but depends on where Voxeo's server is, should try to use user's location instead
- add option to specify area
- cut extra info from address (98105, Seattle, WA -- too much info for the user)
