# Term project for LING 575 Spoken Dialog Systems

## To do
- Requires much better error handling
    - No results from Google Places
    - Text doesn't go through
- Get user's location
- Texting:
    - Add location/business to text message
    - Check to see if texting still works, before offering
- Search location by zip code
- Go through the search results
- Improve pronunciation with a sounded-out result, as well as the real spelling
- Add business type to google search
- Try reducing confidence level to improve mixed initiative

## Notes for project writeup
- Spelling is particularly hard
- Texting will only work until June 10
