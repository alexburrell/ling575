# Term project for LING 575 Spoken Dialog Systems

## To do
- Requires much better error handling
    - No results from Google Places
    - Text doesn't go through
- Handle different orderings of request type/business/location
- Option for getting multiple pieces of info about one business
- Get user's location
- add option to specify area
- cut extra info from address (98105, Seattle, WA -- too much info for the user)
- Texting:
    - Ask if user wants to be texted, before texting
    - Add location/business to text message
    - Check to see if texting still works, before offering
- Once completed, ask if they want any more info

## Notes for project writeup
- Spelling is particularly hard
- Texting will only work until __date__
