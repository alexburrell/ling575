# Term project for LING 575 Spoken Dialog Systems

## To do
- Get user's location
- add option to specify area
- cut extra info from address (98105, Seattle, WA -- too much info for the user)
- Texting:
    - Ask if user wants to be texted, before texting
    - Add location/business to text message

## Things to try:
- <say-as interpret-as="telephone">
-

## Notes for project writeup
- Spelling is particularly hard
- Texting will only work until __date__
