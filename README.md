# Term project for LING 575 Spoken Dialog Systems

## Directions for use

**Phone Number: 202-660-1401**
**Source: https://github.com/alexburrell/ling575**

How to start:
- "Hours for Safeway in Santa Cruz"
- "Please tell me the phone number for Safeway in Santa Cruz"
- "Give me the address for Target"
- "Where is Target?"
- "I'm looking for Starbucks in Seattle"

The system is looking for a request type (hours, phone, address), a location (city), and a business (store or restaurant name). It will prompt for any information you've left out, or if it has trouble understanding your initial utterance.

After providing the information you asked for, you have the option to get more information about that business, or have the information texted to you. **Note: Texting will only work through June 10, due to Voxeo's service limitations.**

At any time, say "Main" or "Main Menu" to start over.
